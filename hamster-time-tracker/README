# Hamster Time Tracker Container

This creates a Docker container with Hamster Time Tracker service running, and
exposing the D-Bus interface through TCP network.


## Building

`docker-compose` is used to build and start/stop the container. Before building,
ensure the `UID` and `DISPLAY` environment variables are correctly exported.

```
export UID
export DISPLAY
docker-compose build
```


## Running

For the first execution, a Docker volume must be created so data is stored
persistently. This allow to update the container without loosing the data.

```
docker volume create hamster-time-tracker
```

From now on, start the container with `docker-compose up -d` and stop it with
`docker-compose down`.

The D-Bus service will be listening in `tcp:host=localhost,bind=*,port=12434`.
